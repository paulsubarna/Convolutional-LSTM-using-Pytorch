# Convolutional-LSTM-using-Pytorch
This repository contains the implementation of Convolutional LSTM as described in the paper: "Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning
Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting"

This implementation is particularly focused on Vibrational sensor dataset or time series dataset with a desired shape of (batch,seq,input_features) or (seq,batch,input_features) in comparison to images used in the original paper.
