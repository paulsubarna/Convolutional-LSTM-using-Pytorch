# Convolutional-LSTM-using-Pytorch
This repository contains the implementation of Convolutional LSTM as described in the paper: "Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning
Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting"

This implementation is particularly focused on Vibrational data or time series dataset with a desired shape of (batch,seq,input_features) or (seq,batch,input_features) in comparison to image used in the original paper.

The implementation leverages some of the key points of implementing traditional lstm such as including peephole connections, option to have the output with your desired step.

Note:
This repository is still work in progress. 
In the coming days I will update this read me file with a small guide how to use this repo.
